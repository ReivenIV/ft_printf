# TO DO list: 

- [ ] Learn about variadic functionns. 
- [ ] Think if you want or not do the bonus. (will impact the code)
      - [ ] Do you want/need to use linked lists, mallocs, crazy things ?? 
- [ ] understand and test printf behaviors : 
     - - [ ] `%%`
     - - [ ] `%c`
     - - [ ] `%s`
     - - [ ] `%i`
     - - [ ] `%d`
     - - [ ] `%u`
     - - [ ] `%x`
     - - [ ] `%X`
     - - [ ] `%p`
     - - [ ] Remember that printf returns the length value (test that to).
- [ ] Start your code printing easy ones. `%%`, `%c`.
- [ ] Think about an scalabel solution that fit in function max 25 lines. 
- [ ] Do all %
- [ ] Test test test and more test don t foget edges cases like mins and maxs.
